<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm financial services professional with more than 13 years (lucky number) of expertise related to Basic materials on private and public sides of corporate/investment banking. My major aspiration in profession was and is to be helpful to my clients; be it: me asking you difficult questions or answering yours so that at the end your company earned money (seems like a pretty universal measure of being helpful in financial world). 
Sector expertise wise on top to Basic materials I'm a keen learner in FinTech, TMT and e-Commerce. 
I'm super active and an avid traveller. Seeing the world definitely broadens horizons and brings more great people in life! I like speed and beautiful cars; you don't have to ask me twice to drive one of those: in a very socially responsible way on one of the public roads and with a full throattle at a racing curcuit.
I'm geniunely curious with a questioning mind-set and I don't take "No" for an answer. I'm living my dream and I wish everyone is doing the same...
and here is for Global Peace!</p>
